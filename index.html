<h3> About Me: </h3>
<p><strong>Hello! My name is Mikha.</strong>
I'm 20 years old, I graduated in Malate Catholic School
and is now studying in Asia Pacific College studying Multimedia Arts! <em>Why did I pursue this course?</em> Simple,
because I want to either pursue my hobby which is digital drawing or Video editing. I love to make story videos,
character concepts, character designs, stories and I hope to make good story videos or digital art stories for 
everyone to enjoy like the people I admire. </p>
